This Project is a personal one. It is mostly done to teach myself basic concepts of programming, as well as to learn more about Java. The inspiration for this is Node.RED aswell as CodeSys. Those 2 give lower skilled people the ability to programm using easy to understand, and use, Blocks. Users with more experience can code more advanced blocks.

There are several Objectives for this Project:
-Implementation of a Grafical Logic Editor
-Easy for others to add their own Logic Blocks thanks to auto generated GUI aswell as ready to extend classes that have all the dirty work done
-Saving the configuration to a savefile
-running the savefile on a GUI less version for fun Projects
-Maybe help people who are trying to teach logic based stuff?

As I am currently redoing 90% of everything (for the 2nd time), dont expect much to work
